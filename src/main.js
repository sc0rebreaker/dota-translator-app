// it is translated; Ctrl+A, Ctrl+V, Enter to put the translation in its
// place and say it. Team or all chat is whichever the player opened.
//
// It is INPUT and nothing else. Nothing is written to the game's memory,
// and the game's process is not even opened for this. (The user asked

// keypresses and two waits for one line, and it took the keyboard off the
