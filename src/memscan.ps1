# Reads Dota 2's chat out of the running game's memory and prints each
# line it finds as one JSON object on stdout.
#
# Long-lived on purpose: it is spawned ONCE and kept, so nothing pays for
# PowerShell's startup or the C# compile per poll.
#
# Nothing is written to the game. This opens the process with
# PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION - read and ask, no more -
# and never calls WriteProcessMemory. That is the whole of its access.
#
# Why PowerShell at all: it keeps the tool at ZERO runtime dependencies
# and ships no compiled binary, so "is this a virus" is answerable by
# reading this file. The scanning loop itself is C# via Add-Type because a
# PowerShell byte loop over 4 GB never finishes.
#
# Protocol, one JSON object per line:
#   {"t":"status","state":"waiting|scanning|reading","pid":N,"detail":"..."}
#   {"t":"line","b64":"<the line, UTF-8, base64>","a":<address>,"w":0|1,
#    "r":<region base>,"rs":<region size>,"ab":<allocation base>,"p":0|1}
#   {"t":"stat","full":bool,"mode":"full|wide|win","ms":N,"mb":N,
#    "regions":N,"hits":N,"hot":N,"winMb":N}
#   {"t":"find","panels":N,"ms":N,"mb":N}      a search for the chat panel
#   {"t":"stat","mode":"panel","ms":N,"kb":N,"hits":N,"panels":"0xADDR:count ..."}
#   {"t":"error","detail":"..."}
#
# THE CHAT PANEL COMES FIRST (see "THE CHAT PANEL" below): when the game's
# own chat container can be found, a poll is a few KB of it and none of
# the scans below run at all. They are what happens until it is found,
# and the fallback for the day its layout changes.
#
# Three kinds of scan, from dearest to cheapest:
#   full  every byte of the process. Finds which ALLOCATIONS hold chat.
#   wide  every region of those allocations (~710 MB in a live match).
#   win   only a window around the addresses where a line has been seen.
# "a" is where the line was found and "w" whether that was inside the
# windows as they stood BEFORE the scan - together they are what says
# whether windows are any good, which is NOT yet known (see CLAUDE.md).
